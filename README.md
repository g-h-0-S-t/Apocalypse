This is a POST-Ping-Flood-Attack Tool.  

By default, it tries to fire **1 request per millisecond, or ASAP** (@ line no. 128, var limiter, and line no. 150 for the milliseconds which is currently defaulted to 0). You can modify it @ your will. Be generous with **limiter**, **increasing beyond what your RAM can handle might end up crashing your browser**. Check Browser console logs for it's operation validity.  

Use ' -incognito --disable-ipc-flooding-protection' flag before running this tool in Chrome (right click on Chrome short-cut, go to properties, paste the flag at the end inside 'Target')  

Pass single or multiple comma separtated URLs in the textarea and click the button to initiate the attack.

# Apocalypse (Disclaimer : Usage of profanity. Proceed cautiously.)
This is a POST-Ping-Flood-Attack Tool (**Ping flood / ICMP flood**, a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack tool**).  

By default, it tries to fire **1 request per millisecond, or ASAP** (@ line no. 128, **var limiter**, and line no. 150 for the milliseconds which is currently defaulted to 0). You can modify it @ your will. Be generous with **limiter**, **increasing beyond what your RAM & CPU can handle might end up crashing your browser**. Check Browser **console logs** & **network tab** for it's operational validity.  

Use ' **-incognito --disable-ipc-flooding-protection**' flag before running this tool in Chrome (right click on Chrome shortcut, go to properties, paste the flag at the end inside 'Target')  

Pass single or multiple comma separated URLs in the textarea and click the button to initiate the attack.  

**Remember:**  
**(1). more URLS = more load for your machine/device**  
**(2). higher values of limiter = more load for your machine/device**
